# Project 0
Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project's aim is to build a website using HTML, CSS and SCSS.
The websiste should use bootstrap and adapt to different screen sizes.

I created a website that presents the different roman emperors of the Principate era.
Index.html is the main page of the webste. It allows users to select the era they want to see or navigate with the navbar
The other html pages are the different eras.
styles.scss is the files used to define the different styling elements of the website. It is converted into an HTML readable .scss format by Sass.
The Images folder contains the pictures of the emperors to be used in each era page.
